There are more than 80 universities founded since then and we are the best of them and we want to include our faculty in this. We support the academic activities of our faculty members abroad. We want them to go to congress there, introduce us there, make presentations there and bring faculty members to us from there. In the sense of internationalization, we conduct cooperation protocols with universities in many countries about Erasmus and Mevlana student exchange programs. These studies will continue to increase after that.”</p>
<p><strong>What is Erasmus? </strong></p>
<p>Erasmus program is a European Union program to encourage higher education institutions in Europe to engage in multi-faceted cooperation with each other. It provides gratuitous financial support as a grant to higher education institutions to be able to produce joint projects with each other and carry into effect and to exchange students and academic staff in a short-term.</p>
<p>Higher education institutions of 27 member states of the European Union, and the countries that are not members of the European Union but members of the European Economic Area Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and candidate countries to become a member of the European Union Turkey, Croatia and Macedonia can benefit from Erasmus program.</p></h3>
