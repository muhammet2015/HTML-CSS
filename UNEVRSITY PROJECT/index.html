	<center><h1>KBU is on the way of being a world university</h1></center>
<h4>Rector Prof. Dr. Refik Polat said on our university’s 10th-anniversary events that “Karabük University is in a serious rise by signing important works in the international field. The number of students increased this year as well and reached to 56 thousand and among these 3 thousand six hundred are foreign students.”


“We are among the top 5 universities with the most international students in Turkey”

Rector Prof. Dr. Refik Polat also said in his remarks that “We aim to turn Karabük into one of the main centers in Turkey in international student dimension. We are among the top 5 universities that hold the most international students among Turkey’s universities. We gradually include international faculty in this. Our friends are working on this issue. Of course, we need to do so to be an international university.”</h4><br><br>

<h4>“We are increasing cooperation to become a world university”

Rector Polat stated in his remarks that when you look at universities entering the world rankings, you see that there are some criteria for entering this sequence. “One of them is the number of international students and the number of international teachers. In this regard, you need to be in an important place, so we are trying to do exactly that for Karabük. We needed to start in a way.”

Rector Polat said another important factor is to be in cooperation with international universities. “We started to organize congress and symposiums with many universities abroad. In October we have two symposiums like this. We are moving fast in this regard. I hope we will complete the other steps. Maybe not in our period, but I guess in 10 years Karabük University will take its place in the world rate, which will amaze everybody.”</h4>
